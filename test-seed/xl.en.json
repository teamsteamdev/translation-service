"EXTRA LONG PARAGRAPH: As used in this book, sabiduría means living y thinking según de Dios truth, purposes y design. It means putting right knowledge into action y approaching all of life from de Dios point of view. A wise person believes that everything Dios says is right y true y considers his Palabra to be the only worthy standard by which to live. Gaining sabiduría is far better than possessing great wealth (3:13-14). The highest sabiduría comes only to those who search deeply for it through a proper comunión con Dios (v. 7) y a careful attention to his Palabra (3:1-3). Christ, whom the NT says is the full sabiduría of Dios (1Co 1:30; Col 2:2-3), teaches us that we gain sabiduría by spending time in his Palabra, by allowing his words to become part of us (Jn 15:7) y by submitting control of our hearts y minds to the Espíritu Santo (Jn 14:16-26). A reverent awe (i.e., holy wonder y respect) of de Dios power, majesty, authority y holiness produces in us a godly fear of disobeying o ignoring what he has revealed to us in his Palabra. This attitude is essential to gaining true sabiduría that makes a difference in our thoughts y behaviors. Early in life young people face persuasive temptations from many ungodly sources, which challenge them to defy de Dios standards y go their own ways. Peer pressure will tempt them to follow the crowd y participate in all kinds of sinful (i.e., ungodly, immoral, destructive, rebellious) pleasures. We can resist such temptations to defy Dios by completely surrendering the leadership of our lives to Cristo y by developing a close personal comunión con him. We must also be willing to stand alone, if necessary. For in our commitment to Dios (vv. 15-16), we must realize that spiritual compromise y sinful pleasure will, in the end, lead to heartache, distress, tragedy y destruction (v. 27; véase Mt 4:1-11, nota)."
