    "We all experience times when we feel spiritually dry, empty y unproductive (cf. Sal 44). However, this should not be the normal condition for the believer. God desires to be active in the lives of his people. This psalm expresses trust y confidence in God during a time when the situations of life are not stable or secure. (1) The power y ability to face the difficulties y uncertainties of life are found in God. The word \"refuge\" gives the picture of a shelter from danger. God is our true security in the storms of life (véase Is 4:5-6). \"Strength\" refers to his power when we are battling spiritual enemies (21:8; Éx 15:13). If we patiently trust God, he will reveal this power through us (Col 1:29) so that we overcome the obstacles of life.",
    "\t(2) The end result is that God is \"an ever-present help in trouble.\" He is available y wants his people to call on him for help in times of need (Heb 4:16). His power y presence are enough to handle any situation. Since he never leaves us, we have no reason to be afraid (23:4; Heb 13:5)."
