    "Chapter Introduction",
    "Current events and news reports of wars, tragedies, and natural disasters spur interest in a study of the book of Revelation. What does it reveal about the future? But a better reason for studying Revelation is for what it reveals about Jesus. As we learn in this final lesson, Revelation reveals more about Jesus than any other book in the Bible, giving more than seventy descriptions of our Savior. While the Gospels tell about Christ’s first coming, Revelation describes His second coming as the King of kings and Lord of lords to reward His holy ones and judge His enemies. The great theme of Revelation is that Jesus wins, and those who overcome evil will reign with Him.",
    "13.1 The Background of Revelation",
    "Review with students. The word revelation comes from the Greek word apokalupto, meaning to “unveil” or “uncover” something hidden. Apocalyptic books such as Daniel and Revelation use visions and symbols to unveil the future. Review the two ways Revelation does this:",
    "(1) by letting us see Jesus in His glory through vivid word pictures and descriptions and (2) by foretelling such events as Jesus’ return to conquer evil. In this way, Revelation unveils Jesus and His future victory.",
    "Group Discussion: When do scholars believe Revelation was written, and from what location?",
    "Most early church fathers and historians agreed that Revelation was written about AD 95. The book itself identifies the location of its origin—the island of Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea.",
    "Review with students. Ask students to name the four reasons we conclude that the writer of Revelation is the apostle John, the son of Zebedee and brother of James:",
    "The author refers to himself as John four times (Revelation 1:1, 4, 9; 22:8).",
    "The author says he was on the island of Patmos and was suffering (Revelation 1:9); we believe John was banished to Patmos.",
    "Some phrases and subjects in Revelation are similar to those in John’s Gospel and three Epistles.",
    "Many early church fathers and historians agreed that the apostle John was the author.",
    "Group Discussion: What was significant about the island of Patmos, where John wrote Revelation, as it relates to suffering and persecution? Who was persecuting John and other Christians?",
    "The Roman government sent criminals to Patmos to serve time or to die. John was not alone on the island. Either Domitian or one of his governors exiled John to Patmos, possibly for proselytizing or for propagating a superstition. John was facing persecution himself and wrote to the church suffering similar persecution from the Roman government as well as from unbelieving Jews.",
    "DISPLAY VISUAL 45 Emphasize the two great themes of Revelation. Read aloud the key verses given as you discuss each point.",
    "Revelation’s Great Themes",
    "Jesus will return to triumph over all evil (Revelation 1:7).",
    "Only those who overcome evil in this life will inherit the Kingdom (Revelation 14:9–12; 2:10).",
    "13.2 Understanding Revelation",
    "Review with students. If possible, divide the class into four groups and assign each group one of the four approaches to interpreting Revelation as discussed in today’s study: the past or preterist view; the historicist or historical view; the spiritual or idealist view; and the futurist view. (If you have a small class, you may prefer to have two groups each tackle two of the interpretations.) Students should summarize what their assigned group believes and how it approaches Revelation, along with any strengths or weaknesses. Ask each group to explain areas of agreement and disagreement they have with this particular view. After all approaches to interpreting Revelation have been discussed, ask students to declare which view they most identify with as well as the view taken in this study, the futurist view.",
    "Group Discussion: To balance out this futurist view, we must not forget that prophecy is often fulfilled in two ways. What are these two ways?",
    "Prophecy may have a historical fulfillment and also an end-time fulfillment, such as Jesus’ prophecy in Matthew 24. Some of these events were fulfilled historically in AD 70 with the destruction of Jerusalem, but the greatest fulfillment will come at the end of the age.",
    "DISPLAY VISUAL 46 Read aloud Revelation 1:19, and explore its parts as a natural outline of the book. Challenge students to memorize this verse as a handy guide to understanding the structure and teaching of Revelation.",
    "Natural Outline of Revelation",
    "“Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later” (Revelation 1:19).",
    "What you have seen—refers to the vision John saw of Christ (Revelation 1).",
    "What is now—refers to the seven churches in Asia Minor (Revelation 2 to 3).",
    "What will take place later—refers to the future (Revelation 4 to 22).",
    "Distribute Worksheet 15—Revelations of Jesus. Because we read so many descriptions and images of Jesus in Revelation, you may want to assign each student a certain number of them to look up and summarize—perhaps five each. Be certain a maximum number of revelations are covered by students and shared with the class.",
    "Group Discussion: Which picture or truth about Jesus in Revelation is most meaningful to you? Explain why it is personally meaningful.",
    "Personal answers will vary."
